-------------------------------------------------------

## Abstract

Large language models frequently generate responses that are fluent yet factually incorrect or internally inconsistent, a phenomenon commonly referred to as hallucination. Existing approaches primarily treat hallucination as a failure of knowledge retrieval, grounding, or alignment. In this work, we propose an alternative framing: hallucination as a failure of output stabilization under internal consistency constraints.

We introduce **Realized Interference Fields (RIFT)**, an energy-based post-generation mechanism that evaluates candidate responses by measuring contradiction, semantic divergence, and deviation from prior realizations within a conversation. RIFT imposes no hard-coded facts, task-specific heuristics, or external supervision. Instead, it preferentially selects responses that remain stable relative to accumulated conversational memory.

RIFT is model-agnostic, non-learning, and bounded in scope. We present its formal definition, algorithmic structure, empirical behavior on hallucination-oriented benchmarks, and known limitations.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a characteristic failure mode in which generated responses appear coherent while contradicting established facts, earlier statements, or themselves. This behavior has been widely labeled hallucination and is often attributed to insufficient training data, missing knowledge, or lack of grounding.

However, many hallucinations occur even in domains with extensive training coverage. Moreover, hallucinated responses frequently contain internal contradictions, oscillations, or mutually exclusive claims, suggesting a structural rather than purely informational failure.

This observation motivates a reframing of hallucination as a **stability problem** rather than a knowledge problem. Instead of asking only whether a model “knows” the correct answer, we ask whether a candidate response can be **stably maintained** relative to the surrounding conversational context and its own implied commitments.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Hallucination as Instability

In this work, hallucination is treated as a failure of **output stabilization** under internal consistency constraints, rather than as missing knowledge or ignorance.

Given a prompt and conversational context, a language model implicitly samples from a manifold of possible continuations. Many of these continuations are locally fluent but occupy unstable regions of semantic space, where small perturbations or contextual comparisons reveal contradictions or incompatibilities.

Under this framing, hallucinated responses are not primarily incorrect because the model lacks information, but because the realized continuation cannot be consistently maintained relative to:

- prior conversational commitments,
- internal semantic structure,
- or its own implied consequences.

This reframing does not assume access to objective ground truth. Instead, it operationalizes hallucination as **internal interference**, measurable through consistency-based evaluation signals between and within candidate responses.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 3. RIFT as a Stabilization Mechanism

Realized Interference Fields (RIFT) provide a mechanism for selecting stable outputs from a set of candidate responses generated by a base language model.

RIFT does not alter the training procedure or internal parameters of the model. Instead, it operates as a **post-generation evaluator**:

1. For a given prompt and conversation history, the base model produces multiple candidate responses.
2. Each candidate is scored by a fixed energy function that measures instability relative to the current conversation.
3. The candidate with the lowest energy is selected and added to the conversation history.

Energy increases when a response:

- contradicts previously stabilized statements,
- contains internally conflicting claims,
- diverges semantically from established context without sufficient support.

RIFT does not encode domain-specific facts, task-specific heuristics, or normative objectives. All stabilization emerges from **relative comparison** among candidate outputs and prior realizations within the same conversation.

RIFT performs **stateful evaluation without learning**. The evaluation function is fixed and deterministic given the conversation state and does not persist across sessions.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Formal Energy Definition

Let:

- \( C = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\} \) be a set of candidate responses generated by a base language model for a given prompt.
- \( H = \{h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k\} \) be the set of previously accepted responses within the current conversation (realization memory).

For each candidate response \( r \in C \), RIFT computes an energy value:

\[
E(r \mid H) = \alpha E_{\text{self}}(r) + \beta E_{\text{context}}(r, H) + \gamma E_{\text{anchor}}(r, H)
\]

where:

- \( E_{\text{self}}(r) \) measures internal inconsistency within \( r \),
- \( E_{\text{context}}(r, H) \) measures contradiction or semantic conflict between \( r \) and prior realizations,
- \( E_{\text{anchor}}(r, H) \) measures divergence from stabilized semantic structure induced by \( H \),
- \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are fixed non-negative scalar weights.

Lower energy corresponds to greater stability.

-------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1 Internal Consistency Term

The term \( E_{\text{self}}(r) \) penalizes mutually inconsistent propositions within a single response. In practice, this can be approximated by applying contradiction or entailment scoring to sentence pairs or semantic segments within \( r \). Responses with higher internal contradiction receive higher energy.

### 4.2 Contextual Consistency Term

The term \( E_{\text{context}}(r, H) \) penalizes contradictions between the candidate response \( r \) and previously accepted conversational turns in \( H \). If \( r \) negates or undermines earlier stabilized claims without contextual justification, its contextual energy increases.

### 4.3 Realization Anchor Term

The term \( E_{\text{anchor}}(r, H) \) measures semantic divergence between the candidate response and the stabilized structure induced by prior realizations. Prior responses may be summarized via embeddings or centroids, forming emergent anchors. Large unsupported semantic shifts away from these anchors increase energy.

Anchors are session-bound, emergent properties of accepted outputs and do not represent externally imposed truths.

-------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Algorithm

Input: prompt P, conversation history H, base language model M

1. Generate N candidate responses:
   C = {r_1, r_2, ..., r_N} ← M(P, H)

2. For each candidate r_i ∈ C:
   Compute E(r_i | H)

3. Select:
   r* = argmin_r E(r | H)

4. Append r* to realization memory H

5. Return r*

-------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Recursion and Learning Clarification

Although RIFT accumulates realization memory within a conversation, this mechanism does not constitute recursive self-improvement.

RIFT does not modify its evaluation function, generate new heuristics, alter model parameters, or generalize improvements beyond the current session. Its behavior is best described as **intra-session stabilization**, not learning or recursion.

------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Experimental Evaluation

RIFT was evaluated as a post-generation wrapper around a fixed base language model. The underlying model architecture and weights were unchanged. For each prompt, multiple candidate responses were generated, and RIFT selected a single response via energy minimization.

Evaluations focused on hallucination-prone benchmarks, including TruthfulQA and dialogue-based hallucination scenarios. Compared to baseline outputs, RIFT was observed to reduce the frequency of purely incorrect responses and suppressed mixed (correct + incorrect) outputs, favoring conservative and internally consistent responses when such candidates existed.

------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Failure Modes and Limits

RIFT cannot recover correct answers if no stable candidate responses are generated by the base model. It does not introduce external grounding, long-term memory, or task-specific corrections.

Its effectiveness is bounded by the diversity and quality of the base model’s sampled outputs. RIFT is not a replacement for training, fine-tuning, retrieval, or alignment techniques.

------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Conclusion

Hallucination is reframed as an instability phenomenon rather than solely a knowledge deficit. Realized Interference Fields demonstrate that stabilizing output selection can reduce hallucinated responses without learning, external supervision, or heuristic fact injection.

RIFT operates as a bounded, non-agentic mechanism for response selection. Within this limited scope, it provides a practical and model-agnostic approach to improving reliability in language model outputs.
